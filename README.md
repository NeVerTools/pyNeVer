Neural networks Verifier (__NeVer 2__) is a tool for the design, training and verification of neural networks.
It supports feed-forward and residual neural networks with ReLU and activation functions.
__pyNeVer__ is the corresponding python package providing all the main capabilities of __NeVer 2__
and can be easily installed using pip. 

Installation and setup
----------------------

__pyNeVer__ depends on several packages, which are all available via pip and should be installed automatically. 
The packages required for the correct execution are the following:

* _numpy_
* _ortools_
* _onnx_
* _torch_
* _torchvision_
* _pysmt_
* _multipledispatch_

To install __pyNeVer__ as an API, run the command:
```bash
pip install pynever
```

To run __pyNeVer__ as a standalone tool you should clone this repository and create a conda environment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nevertools/pyNeVer
cd pyNeVer

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate pynever
```

Command-line interface
----------------------
To verify [VNN-LIB](https://www.vnnlib.org) specifications on ONNX models we provide two scripts: one for single instances and another one for multiple instances.
To verify a single instance run
```bash
python never2_launcher.py [-o OUTPUT] [-t TIMEOUT] model.onnx property.vnnlib {sslp|ssbp}
```

For multiple instances collected in a CSV file run
```bash
python never2_batch.py [-o OUTPUT] [-t TIMEOUT] instances.csv {sslp|ssbp}
```
* The -o option should be used to specify the output CSV file to save results, otherwise it will be generated in the same directory
* The -t option specifies the timeout for each run
* sslp and ssbp are the two algorithms employed by _NeVer2_:
  * SSLP (Star-set with Linear Programming) is our first algorithm based on star sets presented in [this paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-024-09907-5).
  * SSBP (Star-set with Bounds Propagation) enhances SSLP with an abstraction-refinement search and symbolic interval propagation. This is the algorithm used in VNNCOMP 2024.

Supported layers
----------------------

At present the __pyNeVer__ package supports abstraction and verification of fully connected and convolutional 
neural networks with ReLU activation functions.

Training and conversion support all the layers supported by [VNN-LIB](https://easychair.org/publications/paper/Qgdn).

The [conversion](pynever/strategies/conversion) package provides the capabilities for the conversion of PyTorch and ONNX
networks: therefore this kind of networks can be loaded using the respective frameworks and then converted to the
internal representation used by __pyNeVer__.  

The properties for the verification and abstraction of the networks must be defined either in python code following
the specification which can be found in the documentation, or via an SMT-LIB file compliant to the 
[VNN-LIB](https://www.vnnlib.org) standard.
