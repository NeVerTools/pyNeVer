# ACC (Adaptive Cruise Control)

This set of benchmarks is related to the problem of the controller for an ACC application.

This benchmark is taken from the paper _Formal Verification of Neural Networks: a Case Study about Adaptive Cruise Control_ presented at [ECMS 2022](https://www.scs-europe.net/dlib/2022/ecms2022acceptedpapers/0310_dis_ecms2022_0075.pdf) where a neural network controller is used to read the speed of the car and the distance from other vehicles and output the desired acceleration value.
